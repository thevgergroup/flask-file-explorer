# PLAN to Reconcile and Merge Open PRs in Flask-File-Explorer

## Objective
The objective of this plan is to review all open pull requests (PRs) for the flask-file-explorer repository, reconcile any conflicts, ensure code quality and compatibility, and merge them into the main branch.

## Steps to Complete Action

1. **List all Open PRs**
   - Retrieve a list of all open PRs from the flask-file-explorer repository.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Compilation of all open PRs for review.

2. **Review Each PR**
   - Thoroughly review each PR for code quality, alignment with the project's goals, and potential conflicts with the existing codebase.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Identification of PRs that are ready to merge, need adjustments, or require additional information.

3. **Test the Changes Locally**
   - Clone the PR branches locally and run tests to ensure there are no bugs or errors introduced.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Confirmation that changes are stable and do not break existing functionality.

4. **Resolve Conflicts**
   - Address any merge conflicts by collaborating with PR authors or resolving issues manually.
   - **Expected Outcome:** All conflicts resolved, with clear and concise code that is ready for integration.

5. **Ensure Compliance with Coding Standards**
   - Verify that the code complies with the organization's coding standards and includes appropriate documentation/comments.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Compliance with code quality standards, ensuring maintainability and readability.

6. **Finalize and Merge PRs**
   - Merge PRs that have passed testing and review into the main branch.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Selected PRs successfully merged into the main branch, enhancing the project's functionality.

## Dependencies or Prerequisites
- Access to the GitHub repository to review PRs and permissions to merge them into the main branch.
- Development environment set up for testing changes made in PRs.
- Collaboration with contributors may be necessary for resolving conflicts or clarifying any issues related to the PRs.

This plan acts as a comprehensive guide to ensure all steps are systematically followed to integrate new features or bug fixes into the main branch of the flask-file-explorer repository, maintaining the highest standards of code quality and project integrity.

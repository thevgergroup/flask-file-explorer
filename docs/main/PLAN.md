# Plan to Add a Simple .editorconfig File

## Objective
The objective of this plan is to introduce a `.editorconfig` file in the `flask-file-explorer` repository. This file will contain basic coding style settings for both Python and JavaScript files. The `.editorconfig` file helps maintain consistent coding styles across various editors and IDEs used by different developers.

## Steps to Complete the Action

1. **Locate the Root Directory of the Repository**
   - Identify the root directory of the `flask-file-explorer` repository where the `.editorconfig` file should reside.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The path to the repository root is known.
   
2. **Draft the `.editorconfig` File**
   - Write a draft of the `.editorconfig` file that includes:
     - General settings applicable to all files (e.g., `end_of_line = lf`, `insert_final_newline = true`)
     - Specific settings for Python files (e.g., `indent_style = space`, `indent_size = 4`)
     - Specific settings for JavaScript files (e.g., `indent_style = space`, `indent_size = 2`)
   - **Expected Outcome:** A draft version of the `.editorconfig` file is created.

3. **Validate the Draft File**
   - Review the drafted `.editorconfig` file to ensure accuracy and completeness.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The draft is verified to be correct and complete.

4. **Commit the `.editorconfig` File to the Repository**
   - Add the newly created `.editorconfig` file to the repository at the root directory.
   - Commit the change with an appropriate commit message, e.g., "Add .editorconfig file with basic settings for Python and JavaScript."
   - **Expected Outcome:** The `.editorconfig` file is permanently added to the repository's version history.

5. **Push Changes to Remote Repository**
   - Push the commit to the remote repository to ensure all contributors have access to the `.editorconfig` file.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The `.editorconfig` file is available on the remote repository.

6. **Communicate Changes to Team**
   - Inform the development team about the new `.editorconfig` file and encourage its use to ensure consistent coding styles.
   - **Expected Outcome:** Team is aware of the new file and its purpose.

## Dependencies or Prerequisites
- Access to the `flask-file-explorer` repository with the necessary permissions to commit and push changes.
- Basic understanding of coding style settings for Python and JavaScript to create the `.editorconfig` file.

By following the steps outlined in this plan, the repository will benefit from enhanced coding style consistency, improving collaboration and reducing issues related to code formatting.
